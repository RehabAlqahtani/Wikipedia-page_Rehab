                    Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10
                    December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English
                    mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on
                    Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose
                    computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
                    recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
                    calculation. Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet
                    Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke. All
                    Lovelace's half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were
                    born out of wedlock to other women.Byron separated from his
                    wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. He
                    died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother was anxious
                    about her upbringing and promoted Ada's interest in
                    mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from
                    developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this,
                    Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron
                    and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at
                    her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada
                    pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in
                    1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby
                    becoming Countess of Lovelace.

                    Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact
                    with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir
                    David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the
                    author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further
                    her education. Ada described her approach as "poetical
                    science" and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)". When
                    she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long
                    working relationship and friendship with fellow British
                    mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father
                    of computers".She was in particular interested in Babbage's
                    work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him on 5
                    June 1833, when she and her mother attended one of Charles
                    Babbage's Saturday night soirées with their mutual friend,
                    and Ada's private tutor, Mary Somerville. Between 1842 and
                    1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer
                    Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the
                    Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of
                    seven notes, simply called "Notes".

                    Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of
                    computers, especially since the seventh one contained what
                    many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an
                    algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other
                    historians reject this perspective and point out that
                    Babbage's personal notes from 1837 to 1840 contain the first
                    programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the
                    capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or
                    number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage
                    himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of
                    "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the
                    Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how
                    individuals and society relate to technology as a
                    collaborative tool.
