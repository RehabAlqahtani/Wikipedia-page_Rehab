                Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in
                scientific developments and fads of the day, including
                phrenology and mesmerism. After her work with Babbage, Lovelace
                continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she commented to a
                friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical
                model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to
                feelings ("a calculus of the nervous system"). She never
                achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came
                from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother,
                about her "potential" madness. As part of her research into this
                project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in
                1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments. In the
                same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von
                Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published
                and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.In
                1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother
                mentioning "certain productions" she was working on regarding
                the relation of maths and music
              </p>

                Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their
                mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage invited
                Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine.She
                became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship
                with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage
                was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He
                called her "The Enchantress of Number". In 1843, he wrote to
                her: Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its
                multitudinous Charlatans—every thing in short but the
                Enchantress of Number
              </p>
              <p>
                During a nine-month period in 1842–43, Lovelace translated the
                Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's
                newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.With the article,
                she appended a set of notes. Explaining the Analytical Engine's
                function was a difficult task; many other scientists did not
                grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little
                interest in it. Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the
                Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.
                Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael
                Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing
              </p>
              <p>
                The notes are around three times longer than the article itself
                and include (in Note G),in complete detail, a method for
                calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical
                Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built
                (only Babbage's Difference Engine has been built, completed in
                London in 2002). Based on this work, Lovelace is now considered
                by many to be the first computer programmer and her method has
                been called the world's first computer program. Others dispute
                this because some of Charles Babbage's earlier writings could be
                considered computer programs. Note G also contains Lovelace's
                dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that "The
                Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate
                anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.
                It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any
                analytical relations or truths." This objection has been the
                subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing
                in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". Most modern
                computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that
                computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be
                anticipated by programmers.

                Lovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers
                were published, when he tried to leave his own statement
                (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an
                unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted
                as a joint declaration. When Taylor's Scientific Memoirs ruled
                that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace
                asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she
                knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to
                withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised
                that "His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought
                Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her ... because of
                her 'celebrated name'." Their friendship recovered, and they
                continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying
                of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor,
                though this letter did not give him the necessary legal
                authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as
                Philosopher's Walk; it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were
                reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles
