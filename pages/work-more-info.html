            <p>
              In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University
              of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young
              Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy,
              transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was
              subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève
              in October 1842. Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned
              Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then
              augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the
              translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing
              this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are
              more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the
              September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the
              initialism AAL. Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically
              from A to G. In Note G, she describes an algorithm for the
              Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered
              to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for
              implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been
              cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.The engine
              was never completed and so her program was never tested. In 1953,
              more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on
              Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B.
              V. Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing
              Machines. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for
              a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and
              software.

              Insight into potential of computing devices
            </h2>
            <p>
              n her notes, Ada Lovelace emphasised the difference between the
              Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly
              its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any
              complexity.She realised the potential of the device extended far
              beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote: [The
              Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number,
              were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be
              expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and
              which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of
              the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing,
              for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in
              the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible
              of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose
              elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of
              complexity or extent.
            </p>
            <p>
              This analysis was an important development from previous ideas
              about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the
              implications of modern computing one hundred years before they
              were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Ada's insight regarding
              the application of computing to any process based on logical
              symbols to an observation about textiles: "When she saw some
              mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of
              beautiful patterns, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used
              punched cards to make calculations." This insight is seen as
              significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley,
              as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan
              28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical
              Engine.

              <strong>
                According to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron
                Swade</strong
              >: Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In
              Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace
              saw...was that number could represent entities other than
              quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if
              those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes,
              then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one
              instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition
              from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for
              manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental
              transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose
              computation—and looking back from the present high ground of
              modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that
              transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in
              that 1843 paper.

              Distinction between mechanism and logical structure
            </h2>
            <p>
              Lovelace recognized the difference between the details of the
              computing mechanism, as covered in an 1834 article on the
              Difference Engine,and the logical structure of the Analytical
              Engine, on which the article she was reviewing dwelt. She noted
              that different specialists might be required in each area. The
              [1834 article] chiefly treats it under its mechanical aspect,
              entering but slightly into the mathematical principles of which
              that engine is the representative, but giving, in considerable
              length, many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of
              which it tabulates the various orders of differences. M. Menabrea,
              on the contrary, exclusively developes the analytical view; taking
              it for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain
              processes, but without attempting to explain how; and devoting his
              whole attention to explanations and illustrations of the manner in
              which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring
              every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed
              powers of mechanism. It is obvious that, in the invention of a
              calculating engine, these two branches of the subject are equally
              essential fields of investigation... They are indissolubly
              connected, though so different in their intrinsic nature, that
              perhaps the same mind might not be likely to prove equally
              profound or successful in both.

            <h2 class="name-titel-2">Controversy over contribution</h2>
            <p>
              Though Lovelace is often referred to as the first computer
              programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians
              of computing suggest otherwise. Allan G. Bromley, in the 1990
              article Difference and Analytical Engines: All but one of the
              programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from
              three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by
              Babbage for her, although she did detect a "bug" in it. Not only
              is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the
              Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that
              she did not have the knowledge to do so. Bruce Collier wrote that
              Lovelace "made a considerable contribution to publicizing the
              Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the
              design or theory of it in any way".
