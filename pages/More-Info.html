              The computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States
              Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace.The reference
              manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the
              Department of Defense Military Standard for the language,
              MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth. Ada
              Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated on the second Tuesday
              of October,which began in 2009.Its goal is to "... raise the
              profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths,"
              and to "create new role models for girls and women" in these
              fields. Events have included Wikipedia edit-a-thons with the aim
              of improving the representation of women on Wikipedia in terms of
              articles and editors to reduce unintended gender bias on
              Wikipedia. The Ada Initiative was a non-profit organisation
              dedicated to increasing the involvement of women in the free
              culture and open source movements. The building of the department
              of Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol is called
              the Ada Lovelace Building.The Engineering in Computer Science and
              Telecommunications College building in Zaragoza University is
              called the Ada Byron Building. The computer centre in the village
              of Porlock, near where Lovelace lived, is named after her. Ada
              Lovelace House is a council-owned building in Kirkby-in-Ashfield,
              Nottinghamshire, near where Lovelace spent her infancy. In 2012, a
              Google Doodle and blog post honoured her on her birthday. In 2013,
              Ada Developers Academy was founded and named after her.</p>

              The
              mission of Ada Developers Academy is to diversify tech by
              providing women and gender diverse people the skills, experience,
              and community support to become professional software developers
              to change the face of tech. On 17 September 2013, the BBC Radio 4
              biography programme Great Lives devoted an episode to Ada
              Lovelace; she was sponsored by TV presenter Konnie Huq. As of
              November 2015, all new British passports have included an
              illustration of Lovelace and Babbage. In 2017, a Google Doodle
              honoured her with other women on International Women's Day. On 2
              February 2018, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation
              imaging and analytics company, launched a ÑuSat type
              micro-satellite named in honour of Ada Lovelace. In March 2018,
              The New York Times published a belated obituary for Ada Lovelace.
              On 27 July 2018, Senator Ron Wyden submitted, in the United States
              Senate, the designation of 9 October 2018 as National Ada Lovelace
              Day: "To honor the life and contributions of Ada Lovelace as a
              leading woman in science and mathematics". The resolution
              (S.Res.592) was considered, and agreed to without amendment and
              with a preamble by unanimous consent. In November 2020 it was
              announced that Trinity College Dublin whose library had previously
              held forty busts, all of them of men, was commissioning four new
              busts of women, one of whom was to be Lovelace. External videos

              Westminster St Edward”, March 7, 2022. In March 2022, a statue of
              Ada Lovelace was installed at the site of the former Ergon House
              in the City of Westminster, London, honoring its scientific
              history. The redevelopment was part of a complex with Imperial
              Chemical House. The statue was sculpted by Etienne and Mary
              Millner and based on the portrait by Margaret Sarah Carpenter. The
              sculpture was unveiled on International Women's Day, 2022. It
              stands on the 7th floor of Millbank Quarter overlooking the
              junction of Dean Bradley Street and Horseferry Road. In September
              2022, Nvidia announced the Ada Lovelace graphics processing unit
              (GPU) microarchitecture. In July 2023, The UK's Royal Mint issued
              four commemorative £2 coins in various metals to "honour the
              innovative contributions of computer science visionary Ada
              Lovelace and her legacy as a female trailblazer.

In Tom Stoppard's 1993 play Arcadia, the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly—a character "apparently based" on Ada Lovelace (the play also involves Lord Byron)—comes to understand chaos theory, and theorises the second law of thermodynamics, before either is officially recognised.
                In the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, Lovelace delivers a lecture on the "punched cards" programme which proves Gödel's incompleteness theorems decades before their actual discovery. Lovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford's steampunk series, The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency.
                Lovelace features in John Crowley's 2005 novel, Lord Byron's Novel: The Evening Land, as an unseen character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and anti-heroic efforts to archive her father's lost novel.
                The 2015 play Ada and the Engine by Lauren Gunderson portrays Lovelace and Charles Babbage in unrequited love, and it imagines a post-death meeting between Lovelace and her father. Lovelace and Babbage are also the main characters in Sydney Padua's webcomic and graphic novel The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage. The comic features extensive footnotes on the history of Ada Lovelace, and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence.
                Lovelace is a primary character in the 2019 Big Finish Doctor Who audio play The Enchantress of Numbers, starring Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor and Jane Slavin as his current companion, WPC Ann Kelso. Lovelace is played by Finty Williams.
                In 2019, Lovelace is a featured character in the play STEM FEMMES by Philadelphia theater company Applied Mechanics.
               Lovelace was a character in a novel in the extended Assassin's Creed series known as the Magus Conspiracy. In the book. Lovelace was involved in helping create a machine of destruction</p>

              Lovelace, identified as Ada Augusta Byron, is portrayed by Lily Lesser in the second season of The Frankenstein Chronicles. She is employed as an "analyst" to provide the workings of a life-sized humanoid automaton. The brass workings of the machine are reminiscent of Babbage's analytical engine. Her employment is described as keeping her occupied until she returns to her studies in advanced mathematics.
              Lovelace and Babbage appear as characters in the second season of the ITV series Victoria (2017). Emerald Fennell portrays Lovelace in the episode, "The Green-Eyed Monster."
              "Lovelace" is the name of the operating system designed by the character Cameron Howe in Halt and Catch Fire.
